3. Go to your Downloads folder and make sure you have "File Extensions" enabled under View:
4. ![](../.gitbook/assets/bild_2021-05-29_121726.png) 
5. Right-click on the downloaded file and select Rename.
6. Add a `.png` at the end of the file name, so that it is now called e.g.

   `fcf38710-b87a-4236-b7b3-2ba1bbebafdf.png`.

7. Now you can open the file :\)
